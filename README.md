Program to animate 4x4x4 light cube

## Origins
Got a Raspberry Pi and wanted to re-create the project that really got me interested in programming in high school

	*[Raspberry Pi 4 Model B, 4GB RAM](https://www.raspberrypi.org/products/raspberry-pi-4-model-b/)
*Software:
	*Python 3, get the latest version [here](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

## Setup
*4x4x4 LED cube (lots of tutorial on how to make your own online)
*Raspberry Pi (I have 4 model B but it doesn't matter)
*The right connections to the GPIO pins, click [here](See GPIO_plugin.txt)
	Note: Make sure the cathodes (negative/short leads) are pointed down
